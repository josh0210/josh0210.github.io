          William Herschel was a musician born in Hanover in 1738. He moved to
          England in 1757, and settled in Bath where he was a church
          organist.<br /><br />Herschel lived in the time of great scientific
          progress in Europe. He was a passionate astronomer and developed new
          telescopes to fuel his mission to map celestial objects in the night
          sky. His telescopes became so popular that he sold them widely and
          received commissions from royalty.<br /><br />Using his telescopes
          Herschel made many key discoveries:

            Not only significant for being the sixth planet to be discovered,
            Uranus' discovery also doubled the size of the known universe. It's
            discovery propelled him into stardom in the astronomical world,
            exposing him to even greater recognition from the public and
            authorities.

            Uranus, for nearly 50 years, Herschel's instrument was the only one

          Initially constructed in 1783, the 20ft telescope was the favourite of
          Herschel's instruments, and with it he discovered and mapped thousands
          of stars, even expanding our own solar system. It was rebuilt in 1820
          by Herschel and his son John after it deteriorated due to years of
          use.

          The 20ft wooden tube had it's eyepiece atop the telescope, meaning
          Herschel would stand upon an adjustable platform looking down into the
          reflector and observe the night sky. While the tube was made of wood,
          the mirror was made of a mix of copper and tin.

          Arguably Herschel's most important work was completed in collaboration
          with his sister Caroline Herschel. Together they mapped and published
          catalogues of the night sky, including 2500 new nebulae and star
          clusters.<br /><br />
          Caroline Herschel went on to make many key discoveries including seven
          comets. She was the first woman to publish scientific findings in the
          Royal Society and was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical
          Society.<br /><br />
          Many of these key discoveries were made from their house in the City
          of Bath on New King Street.

        Commemorating 200 years since the death of William Herschel, this
        project aims to celebrate his work as well as the impact he had on
        science and the way we view the universe. <br /><br />Showcasing
        Herschel's 20ft telescope, this collaboration between Bath Spa
        University and the Herschel Society in Bath will bring to life the story
        of the 20ft telescope whilst giving furhter insight into the creation of
        this innovative piece of technology.
